  $t$Auto/Rickshaw Broken-Meter Overcharging$t$,
  'high',
  $d$A very widely reported issue. Drivers claim the meter is broken or tampered, then quote flat rates far above actual fare — especially for tourists arriving at Udaipur City Railway Station or Dabok Airport. Drivers may also take deliberately longer routes to run up the charge. Solo women are frequently targeted with inflated quotes. Always agree on a fixed fare before boarding, check the route on Google Maps in real time, or use Ola/Uber for transparent pricing.$d$,

  $d$A long-running scam documented repeatedly in TripAdvisor forums. A well-dressed, charming young man approaches tourists near the lake — between the City Palace and the footbridge — and strikes up a friendly conversation, often referencing a cultural exhibition in Birmingham, Amsterdam, or another city you happen to be from. He then steers you to a shop to view his 'teacher's' or 'grandmother's' work — shawls and scarves falsely sold as real cashmere/pashmina at luxury prices. The goods are synthetic.

  $c$Near the footbridge between the City Palace and Ambrai Ghat there's a charming, well-dressed man who approaches tourists and starts a friendly conversation. He says he's going to your country for an Indian cultural exhibition — he will name the city you're from — and asks if you'd like to see his elderly teacher's embroidery or pashmina work. We followed him, bought two scarves for a shocking amount. They were synthetic, not cashmere at all. Multiple people on TripAdvisor have reported the exact same setup over several years.

The prices I was quoted in the market were frequently double on the dress day. It's not a coincidence. Indian vendors adjust their opening price based on how wealthy you appear to be.

The local people of the Mewar region are genuinely helpful and kind.

Then I realised it wasn't always negative — elderly people, children, families all stared. Once I started smiling or waving, most people smiled back. The intensity of staring that feels hostile in a Western context is often just curiosity.

My approach: politely shake your head and keep walking. For groups of men specifically I always decline — it can become an excuse for physical closeness.

  $c$I stood at Ambrai Ghat and was suddenly hit by a deep unease — almost like a panic attack building. It took about 15 minutes to understand what was wrong: it was the silence. In a country as relentlessly loud as India, stumbling into a stretch where you could hear nothing at all was disorienting. Not unsafe at all — but deeply unfamiliar.

In India, legs attract significantly more attention than shoulders. As a feminist, I wish this were different. But when I'm solo, I prioritise practical safety over my frustration with the system.

  $c$The Lal Ghat area is the most popular base for solo travellers and I'd recommend it for exactly that reason — it's busy, well-lit, and full of guesthouses and cafés that are used to solo women. The area around Jagdish Temple a short walk away is extremely busy until around 9pm. After 10pm the narrower lanes do quiet down significantly.

  $t$Udaipur is one of the best places in India to meet other solo travellers$t$,
  $c$If you're solo and want to find community, Udaipur consistently delivers. I met other solo women at rooftop cafés overlooking Lake Pichola, at the evening performance at Bagore ki Haveli, and at the hostel common areas. The city attracts a slower-travel crowd — people staying 4–7 days rather than passing through in one — so friendships have time to form. Walking in a loose group of travellers also substantially reduces the frequency of touts and unwanted attention.$c$,

  $t$Always check Google Maps during your auto/rickshaw ride$t$,
  $c$This is non-negotiable for me in Udaipur. Not because I feared the driver, but for peace of mind. Twice my driver took a slightly longer route and I was able to point it out and ask them to correct. Most did so without any fuss. The presence of your phone showing a map also signals to the driver that you are aware and paying attention — which on its own often keeps the route honest.$c$,

  $t$Temple priest demanded ₹2,000 for a puja — the real price is ₹50$t$,
  $c$At a small Shiva temple near Lake Pichola a man dressed in saffron who claimed to be the head priest insisted I participate in a 'special blessing' and then demanded ₹2,000 at the end. The actual cost of a standard puja at this kind of temple is ₹30–100. When I offered ₹100 he became aggressive. I walked out. Authentic priests at well-maintained temples (like Jagdish) do not accost tourists at the entrance.$c$,

  $t$Sunrise rooftop tour — genuinely amazing, genuinely safe$t$,
  $c$One of the best things I did in Udaipur was a sunrise rooftop tour arranged through Dreamyard Hostel. Started at 5:30am, walked through the waking old city, watched the sun rise over Lake Pichola. Because it was a small group with a known, hostel-vetted guide, there was zero stress about safety. If you're considering something like this independently, early morning Udaipur is actually very peaceful — chai stalls opening, temple bells, almost no tourist crowd. Just tell someone where you're going.$c$,

  $t$Share your daily itinerary — even just with a hostel receptionist$t$,
  $c$Before every solo outing in Udaipur I told the hostel where I was going and roughly when I'd be back. This isn't paranoia — it's a 60-second habit that creates an accountability anchor. Most hostel staff take note genuinely. If you're in a private guesthouse, text your itinerary to someone at home. The city is safe, but that safety is partly maintained by the collective awareness that solo travellers are being looked out for.$c$,

  $c$Three different men approached me within 100m of the ghat, each quoting different prices (₹500, ₹700, ₹800) for the same boat ride and all claiming to be 'official'. The actual government-run RTDC boat service from Rameshwar Ghat has fixed rates posted on a board — ₹400 per person for a shared ride including Jag Mandir landing, last time I went. It's a queue system. The boats are perfectly fine. Ignore all men who approach you on the path to the ghat.$c$,

Using UPI completely eliminates the fake-note-swap and change-shortchanging scams. It also simplifies transactions in places where your language doesn't overlap. Set up an Indian UPI account linked to a forex-capable card, or carry mostly ₹100 notes rather than ₹500s to minimise exposure.$c$,

  $c$The fort itself is great — 360-degree view of Udaipur at golden hour is extraordinary. But the road back down after 6pm is poorly lit and very quiet, and I was the only tourist on it. Two men on a motorbike slowed down alongside me for about a minute before driving off. Nothing happened, but it was genuinely uncomfortable. Either arrange a return taxi to be waiting, or make sure you leave the fort in enough time to be back on the main road before dark.$c$,

  $c$The stretch from Lal Ghat to Ambrai restaurant is beautiful at night, lit by the glow of the Lake Palace. I've walked it many times. The one time it felt off was at about 10:30pm when it had mostly emptied out and a group of young men were sitting along the wall and called out to me. Nothing escalated. But I walked back via the main road rather than continuing along the lake. The City Palace area is fine until about 9:30pm. The quieter stretches of the lake are best avoided solo after dark.$c$,

  $t$Udaipur for Holi — far better than I expected as a solo woman$t$,
  $c$I had been told to avoid Holi in India entirely as a solo female traveller. Pushkar and Varanasi came with particularly bad warnings about groping under the cover of colour powder. Udaipur was recommended as one of the safer options. My experience confirmed this. The celebrations were joyful, family-dominated, and genuinely inclusive. I stayed in a hostel and joined a group of mixed travellers. At no point did I feel targeted. The city's calmer, romantic character seems to carry over even into its Holi energy.$c$,

Total came to ₹800 extra on a ₹1,200/night room. When I disputed it they produced a laminated sheet of charges I hadn't been shown. I eventually paid half after a standoff.

  $c$TravelLadies.app ranks Udaipur #36 safest for solo female travellers in India with 3.7/5. That feels about right to me.

It also means: don't walk quiet lanes alone after 10pm, use apps not street-hailed autos at night, and expect a handful of scam attempts and staring in any given day. Calibrate your expectations to that band and you'll leave with wonderful memories.$c$,

  $t$Best and worst times to visit for solo women — festival season tips$t$,
  $c$Peak tourist season (October–March) means more tourists, which generally means more safety in numbers but also more scam activity since touts have a larger pool to target. Summer (April–June) is extremely hot but the tourist crowd thins dramatically — some solo women report feeling more exposed without the collective cover of crowds. Avoid visiting during large unstructured festivals if you're solo and new to India. Diwali in Udaipur is safe and beautiful. Holi is manageable with a hostel group.$c$,

  $c$I ate almost entirely at small local restaurants and street stalls in Udaipur and had no stomach issues. Key: eat where there is high turnover and where food is cooked fresh in front of you. The rooftop cafés near Lal Ghat are tourist-priced but completely safe. The dal baati churma near the clock tower and kachori from morning stalls near Sukhadia Circle are exceptional and cheap. Avoid raw salads. Drink only bottled or filtered water. Most places aimed at tourists are meticulous about water because they know their reviews depend on it.$c$,

  $t$How to hire a genuine licensed guide at City Palace$t$,
  $c$Do not accept guide offers from any person who approaches you outside the City Palace entrance — these are unlicensed touts. Once inside the ticket area, there is an official guide booth where licensed guides are registered and the price is fixed. Ask to see a guide's official Tourism Department of Rajasthan ID card before agreeing. A licensed guide for City Palace typically costs ₹300–500 for a 2-hour tour and provides excellent historical depth that unofficial guides simply cannot match.$c$,

  $c$My first hour in Udaipur was chaos — arriving by bus, navigating to my guesthouse with no working SIM, being approached by three different touts before I'd walked 100 metres. I nearly cried. By day two, I had the local rhythm. Start slow: check in, sit somewhere quiet with a chai, observe how things work before venturing further. Udaipur rewards patience.

  $c$TripAdvisor forum users have noted that fake review manipulation is common across Rajasthan, with hotel owners calling guests to pressure them into deleting negative reviews or writing positive ones. When selecting accommodation, weight recent 1- and 2-star reviews heavily — they are harder to suppress. Look for reviews from solo female travellers specifically, as they flag issues (safety, lighting, room locks) that other reviews skip. Cross-reference on both Booking.com and TripAdvisor rather than relying on one platform.$c$,

It signals you are unavailable for interaction without being rude. I used this heavily while walking through busy market areas in Udaipur.

  $t$As a local woman: what worries me about tourism-driven harassment norms$t$,
  $c$I've lived in Udaipur for years and one thing that concerns me is how the tourism economy has created a class of men who see foreign women purely as transaction targets. Most local men are not like this. But the concentrated tourist areas around Lal Ghat have attracted people whose income depends on tourists, and some of that interaction is uncomfortable. This is not Udaipur's character — it is a small minority operating around a valuable economic zone. The solution is to move even slightly away from the absolute tourist core and the dynamic changes completely.$c$,

  $c$The Shilpgram crafts village on the outskirts of Udaipur, near Lake Badi, is one of the better places to buy textiles, ceramics, and folk crafts. The artisans are genuine — many are government-registered — and while bargaining still happens, the hard-sell pressure of the old city markets is significantly lower.

The scams are real but mostly financial rather than physical — overpriced autos, pushy vendors, hotel tricks. The harassment exists but is mostly low-level: staring, selfie requests, touts. Violent crime is not a feature of daily tourist life here. What I'll remember: the sunset from a rooftop over Lake Pichola, the folk music echoing across the water at Bagore ki Haveli, the kindness of the family who ran my guesthouse, and the complete absurdity of a man trying to sell me a 'government-certified sapphire' from a plastic bag.
